# Postcss js.la
postcss is not a postprocessor. The idea behind it is that CSS should be able to be written without a user having to learn some meta language and it's syntax (SASS, LESS). We should be future proofing.

postcss is an ecosystem of plugins that transforms CSS.

- Gulp: ``` npm install gulp-postcss ```
- CLI: ``` npm install -g postcss-cli ```
