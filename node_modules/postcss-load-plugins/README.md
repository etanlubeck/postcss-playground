# postcss-load-plugins

> Loads in any postcss plugins and attaches them to the global scope, or an object of your choice.

## Install

```
npm i postcss-load-plugins
```


## Usage

Given a `package.json` file that has some dependencies within:

```json
{
	"dependencies": {
		"postcss-nested": "*",
		"postcss-mixin": "*",
		"autoprefixer-core": "*"
	}
}
```


```js
var plugins = require('postcss-load-plugins')();
```


Will result in the following happening (roughly, plugins are lazy loaded but in practice you won't notice any difference):

```js
plugins.nested = require('postcss-nested');
plugins.mixin = require('postcss-mixin');
plugins.autoprefixer = require('autoprefixer-core');
```

You can then use the plugins just like you would if you'd manually required them, but referring to them as `plugins.name()`, rather than just `name()`.

This frees you up from having to manually require each postcss plugin.

## Options

You can pass in an object of options that are shown below: (the values for the keys are the defaults):

```js
require('postcss-load-plugins')({
	pattern: [], // the glob(s) to search for. registry.json contains common modules
	config: 'package.json', // where to find the plugins, by default  searched up from process.cwd()
	scope: ['dependencies', 'devDependencies', 'peerDependencies'], // which keys in the config to look within
	replaceString: /^postcss-/, // what to remove from the name of the module when adding it to the context
	camelize: true, // if true, transforms hyphenated plugins names to camel case
	rename: {}, // a mapping of plugins to rename
});
```

## Renaming

You can pass in an object of mappings for renaming plugins. For example, imagine you want to load the `css-mqpacker` plugin, but want to refer to it as just `mqpacker`:

```js
require('postcss-load-plugins')({
	rename: {
		'css-mqpacker': 'mqpacker'
	}
});
```

### Default renames

```json
{
	"autoprefixer-core": "autoprefixer",
	"css-mqpacker": "mqpacker",
    "css-byebye": "byebye"
}
```
